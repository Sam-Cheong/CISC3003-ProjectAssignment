        <h1>About Our Course Enrollment System</h1>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            In Macau, the number of education centers is increasing rapidly as parents and educators place more emphasis on fostering children's interests and talents.
            Recognizing these trends, our project has been developed as a comprehensive Course Enrollment System to meet the specific needs of these educational centers.
